# Getting Started

The easiest way to install is by using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```sh
$ composer require silverstripe/sharedraftcontent
```

You'll also need to run `dev/build`. You should now see a link/button on the bottom-right of edit pages. Clicking the link will generate a new share link.
